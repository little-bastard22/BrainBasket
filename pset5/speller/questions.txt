0.  Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is a 45 char long word (the upper limit of our word length.

1.  getrusage() returns the current resource usage of a process.

2.  struct rusage seems to have 16 (and possibly more) members.

3. Passing before and after by values would create their copies on stack. These structs are fairly large, thus they
could take up a lot of memory and possibly affect the result. By passing reference, we make the process quicker and
not affecting our result.

4.  With each iteration (starting from the first char in file), assigns the current letter (char c) a value read form the file
pointer fp, until EOF is reached. In each loop, it checks whether the c is alpha character or an apostrophe, if true,
adds that character to word array. If the number of characters hits LENGTH, it discards the rest of the alphabetical
string. It also checs for digits, words with digits are discarded. After these checks are passed, we must have found a word and
should check its spelling.

5. We would need to iterate over the string again to discard the word with numerical characters.
Also, discarding longer than LENGTH words would be much more complex, as we would need to check the index before
adding the character to the word array (we easily cause segmentation fault).

6. We need "one-way" or read only pointers. We probably didon't want to have the pointers changed on functions' runtime, i.e.
changing the pointer reference of the checked word or dictionary to some other memory adress (which would really suck).
