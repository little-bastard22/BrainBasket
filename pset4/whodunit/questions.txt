1.  It's a header file that includes typedefs of integer types, such as uint8_t used in bmp.h.
2.  They provide the correct size for pointers and/or structs. (Number of bytes that could be accessed by a pointer or struct attribute).
3.  BYTE is one byte long, DWORD is 4 BYTES, LONG is 4 bytes, WORD is 2 bytes.
4.  A bmp file always starts with 0x4D 0x42.
5.  biSize is constant - it is the size of the bi struct. bfSize differs across different images, as it is dependent on the bitmap size in pixels.
6.  It means that the image starts from the lower right as opposed to upper left.
7.  It is specified by biBitCount.
8.  For infile - the file may not exist. For outfile - program may not be able to write to the disk.
9.  So we read the file one pixel at a time - we have a size of 1 RGPTRIPLE and read 1 element of that size.
10. The padding for width 3 (9bytes) should be 3 (12%9).
11. It "skips" a chunk of data - moves read pointer certain ammount of bytes without actually reading the data.
12. Offset to the current position for fseek function.
